Developers can perform SQL-like queries effortlessly. \n",

The Vector Engine ensures a user-friendly experience, eliminating the need for extensive learning or the adoption of new querying methodologies. Essentially, working with vector embeddings in SAP HANA Cloud is as straightforward as crafting queries in a standard SQL database, offering familiarity and ease of use for developers. -->\n",

This integration eliminates the hurdles posed by data silos, offering a holistic approach to data management.
