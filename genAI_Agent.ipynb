    "# Hands-on Timesheet Management Agent (Exercise #1)\n",
    "This demo focusses on an agent dedicated to assist the user with their timesheet management.\n",
    "This is a scenario where llm-based agents shine as we need to process natural language input. Additionally dynamic decision-making is required, albeit to a limited extent, e.g. the agent needs to decide on the fly whether enough information was provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent's primary capabilities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieving Timesheet Data**: Retrieving records from the SuccessFactor API containing the user's timesheet data.\n",
    "- **Logging work hours**: Log works hours by posting records to the SuccessFactor API based on user input.\n",
    "While there are other use cases that benefit more from agenticness, this demo serves the purpose of getting a good grasp of the core concepts of LangGraph by building a custom agent with human-in-the-loop control mechanisms.\n",

However, the model output is not absolutely deterministic as the underlying caluclations are inherently undeterministic.\n",

This is done by returning a Send object which routes execution. Otherwise the user is asked for confirmation with an interrupt. In contrast to Python's interrupt, execution is not resumed from the interrupt point, but rather the last node is executed again from top to bottom. This can be a common pitfall. When the user has supplied a response, we call a language model to process the user's input and retrieve the structured response. If the user approves we continue execution with the tool node. Otherwise, we update the state by appending a Tool Message and resume execution with the agent node. It is strictly necessary to append a Tool Message as most model providers require every tool call to be accompanied by a corresponding Tool Message."
